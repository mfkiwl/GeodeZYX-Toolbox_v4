1) INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this GeodeZYX toolbox is to provide all the functions which
can be useful for Geodesy and Geophysics. 

It includes low level functions, file management functions,
time and space-coordinates conversion functions, 
data (especially GNSS observations and orbits) retrieve functions, 
plots and visual selection functions ...

It is designed for Python 3 on a LINUX Ubuntu-like system.
Also tested with Anaconda

2) INSTALLATION

2.1) Download the toolbox from GitHub

2.1.1) Github in a nutshell
If you are not familiar with Git and Github have a look in 
https://guides.github.com/

We decide to adopt the forking+pull request workflow
https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/

2.1.2) the proper basic steps
* Create an account on GitHub
* Go on the page of the project :
  https://github.com/GeodeZYX/GeodeZYX-Toolbox_v4
* Fork it, i.e. click on the "Fork" button
* Clone your fork on your computer ("Clone" button) 

2.2) Prerequisite

We suppose that the regular Python libraires (matplotlib, numpy, scipy ...)
are already installed and up-to-date.

You have to install some annex Python libraries which are not installed per default
(tested with Anaconda and Ubuntu). Namely :

tabulate
collections
natsort
pyorbital
sympy
bs4 

2.2.1) With the standard Python Interpreter of Ubuntu (most cases)

* In a terminal use pip to install the libraries :
sudo pip3 -I -U install <name of the library above>

2.2.2) With Anaconda

* update Anaconda first
conda update --all

* Install the package in Anaconda
conda install <name of the library above>

3) Main installation

Since the toolbox is still at the beta level, there is no “pythonic” installation way yet. Here are the two options you have to install the toolbox 

3.1) General installation (recommended)

* In a terminal, edit your .bashrc using e.g. 
nano ~/.bashrc

* add a line 
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:<path to the toolbox>/GeodeZYX-Toolbox_v4/geodezyx

* The toolbox is installed !

3.2) Spyder user

For the ones who use the Graphical User Interface Spyder (which I recommend) :
* click on the “PYTHONPATH manager” button (the Python logo-shaped icon between the spanner icon and the left arrow icon on the main toolbar)
*  add the folder
<path to the toolbox>/GeodeZYX-Toolbox_v4/geodezyx

* The toolbox is installed !

3.3) check the installation

* in a python terminal run 
from geodezyx import *       

If no error appears, then the toolbox is well installed !
Else, it may miss a library. Follow the *prerequisite* section

4) COMPONENTS

conv           : Conversion of time and 
utils          : Shell-like functions (grep, find in folder ...)
                 and functions to optimize list management
time_series    : 
stats          : Low-level statistics functions & outlier detection functions
reffram        : Reference Frame & high-level coordinates conversion
operational    : Download GNSS data/products from various servers
                 Read sitelogs 
files_rw       : read, import & write geodetic files
geodyn         : Euler pole calculator and plot velocity field maps
